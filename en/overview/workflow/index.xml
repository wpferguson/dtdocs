      <description>Before you can do anything in darktable you must first add some images files to the library using the import module in the lighttable view. This will create entries for your images in darktable&amp;rsquo;s library database so that it can keep track of the changes you make. There are three ways to import images, each accessible through buttons in the import module:&#xA;add to library This option adds images to the library without copying or moving &amp;ndash; your original files will stay in their current location and will not be altered.</description>

      <description>This section is intended to get you comfortable processing images in the darkroom view using a scene-referred workflow. You are advised to follow the guidelines provided below, up to the end of the image processing in 3 modules section and then choose other areas to learn as-and-when you need to use those techniques in your images.&#xA;üîógetting started üîótake a well-exposed photograph Good image processing techniques start in the camera &amp;ndash; a well-exposed image (without blown highlights or heavily crushed blacks) will always make post-processing much more straightforward.</description>

      <title>export</title>

      <description>darktable is a non-destructive editor, which means that all changes are recorded in the library database (with a backup stored in an XMP sidecar file), and the original Raw file is left untouched. You therefore need to export images in order to bake your edits into an output file that can be distributed outside of darktable.&#xA;Choose an export scenario.&#xA;The export module offers many options, but by far the most common use is to ‚Äúsave a developed raw image as a JPEG‚Äù.</description>
