      <description>The tethering view allows you to capture images directly into darktable from a connected camera.&#xA;To use the tethering feature you first need to connect your camera to your PC using a USB cable. Your computer might ask to mount or view the connected camera. Do not mount or view the camera. If your camera is mounted or viewed automatically, you will need to ‚Äúunmount/eject‚Äù the camera before darktable can access it.</description>

      <description>The following sections show two typical use cases for the tethering view.&#xA;üîóstudio setup with screening This is a pretty common use case.

Whenever you like, you can review the images directly on your computer monitor instead of using the camera LCD.</description>
