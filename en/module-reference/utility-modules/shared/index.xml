      <description>Filter the collection of images displayed in the lighttable view and filmstrip panel using image attributes, optionally pinning filters to the top panel for quick access.&#xA;Once you have defined a collection of images with the collections module, the collection filters module allows you to define additional filters and sort criteria. For example, you might wish to show all images in a given folder using the collections module and then define additional quick filters to narrow-down by star rating and/or color label.</description>

      <description>Filter the images shown in the lighttable view and filmstrip panel using image attributes. This set of filtered images is known as a collection.&#xA;Importing images into darktable stores information about them (filename, path, Exif data, data from XMP sidecar files etc.) in darktable&amp;rsquo;s library database. A collection may be defined by applying filtering rules to these attributes, thus creating a subset of images to display in the lighttable view and the filmstrip module.</description>

      <description>The filmstrip can be used to quickly switch between images. The images shown are the same as those displayed in the lighttable view and are defined by the currently-selected collection.&#xA;The filmstrip can be switched on and off using the shortcut Ctrl+F. The height of the filmstrip panel can be changed by clicking and dragging its top border.&#xA;Quickly navigate through the images in the filmstrip by scrolling with the mouse.</description>

      <description>Identify which parts of the image contain high contrast details such as edges and textures, which are usually a useful guide to sharpness and therefore focus.&#xA;Activate the module by clicking on the icon. The sharpest parts of the image will be highlighted with a yellow, green and blue overlay:&#xA;Focus peaking works by filtering out most of the image noise, measuring the intensity gradients in the image and calculating average and standard deviation statistics.</description>

      <description>Import and apply GPX track data to a selection of images.&#xA;This module is common to the lighttable and map views. The map view provides an enhanced mode that allows you to preview the position of the images along the GPS tracks while adjusting the images&amp;rsquo; date/time offset and time zone.&#xA;ðŸ”—workflow overview A GPS receiver calculates its current position based on information it receives from satellites, and records it in a GPX file together with the current date and time.</description>

      <description>Edit the metadata of selected images.&#xA;Metadata is freeformat text (title, description, creator, publisher, rights etc.) that describes your images.&#xA;When several images are selected having different values for a given metadata field, the module displays for that field &amp;ndash; if you choose to apply changes, these fields will not be changed. If you right-click on the field the different values are listed at the end of the contextual menu. Select one of the values in the menu to apply that value to all of the selected images &amp;ndash; the change will be saved once you press the &amp;ldquo;apply&amp;rdquo; button or the Enter/Tab key.</description>
