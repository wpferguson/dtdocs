      <description>Remove image noise while preserving structure.&#xA;This is accomplished by averaging each pixel with some surrounding pixels in the image. The weight of such a pixel in the averaging process depends on the similarity of its neighborhood with the neighborhood of the pixel being denoised. A patch with a defined size is used to measure that similarity.&#xA;As denoising is a resource-intensive process, it slows down pixelpipe processing significantly. Consider activating this module late in your workflow.</description>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/base-curve/</guid>
      <description>Simulate the in-camera JPEG by applying a characteristic base curve to the image.&#xA;darktable comes with a number of base curve presets that attempt to mimic the curves of various camera manufacturers. These presets are automatically applied according to the manufacturer ID found in the image&amp;rsquo;s Exif data. Camera-specific base curve presets are also available for some camera models.&#xA;This module will be enabled by default if preferences &amp;gt; processing &amp;gt; auto-apply pixel workflow defaults is set to &amp;ldquo;display-referred&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Degrade parts of the image in an aesthetically pleasing way, in order to anonymize people/objects or hide body parts.&#xA;Censorize works in linear RGB color space to apply a physically-accurate gaussian blur and gaussian luminance noise.&#xA;Aside from anonymization, this module can also be used for a wide range of creative purposes, for example:&#xA;Combine a simple blur with a multiply blend mode to create a realistic bloom (Orton effect). Combine a simple blur with a subtract blending mode and low opacity to create an unsharp mask, similar to the sharpen module but in an RGB scene-referred space.</description>

      <description>Selectively adjust the hue, saturation, and/or brightness of pixels based on their current hue.&#xA;This module is an attempt to recreate some of the functionality of the color zones module in the scene-referred part of the pipeline whilst overcoming some of that module&amp;rsquo;s limitations. Specifically, the color zones module is prone to increase chroma/luma noise, and introduce artefacts or harsh transitions. These are somewhat mitigated within color equalizer with the following additions:</description>

      <description>Recover color information in blown-out highlights.&#xA;Due to the nature of digital sensors, overexposed highlights lack valid color information. Most frequently they appear neutral white or exhibit some color cast, depending on what other image processing steps are involved. This module can be used to “heal” overexposed highlights by replacing their colors with better fitting ones. The module acts on pixels whose luminance exceeds a user-defined threshold. Replacement colors are taken from neighboring pixels.</description>

      <description>Control how raw files are demosaiced.&#xA;🔗bayer filters The sensor cells of a digital camera are not color-sensitive &amp;ndash; they are only able to record different levels of lightness. In order to obtain a color image, each cell is covered by a color filter (red, green or blue) that primarily passes light of that color. This means that each pixel of the raw image only contains information about a single color channel.</description>

      <description>An easy to use and highly efficient denoise module, adapted to the individual noise profiles of a wide range of camera sensors.&#xA;One issue with a lot of denoising algorithms is that they assume that the variance of the noise is independent of the luminosity of the signal. By profiling the noise characteristics of a camera&amp;rsquo;s sensor at different ISO settings, the variance at different luminosities can be assessed, and the denoising algorithm can be adjusted to more evenly smooth out the noise.</description>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/diffuse/</guid>
      <description>Diffusion is a family of physical processes by which particles move and spread gradually with time, from a source that generates them. In image processing, diffusion mostly occurs in two places:&#xA;diffusion of photons through lens glass (blur) or humid air (hazing), diffusion of pigments in wet inks or watercolors. In both cases, diffusion makes the image less sharp by &amp;ldquo;leaking&amp;rdquo; particles and smoothing local variations.&#xA;The diffuse or sharpen module uses a generalized physical model to describe several kinds of diffusion, and can be used by image makers to either simulate or revert diffusion processes.</description>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/dither-or-posterize/</guid>
      <description>This module eliminates some of the banding artifacts that can result when darktable&amp;rsquo;s internal 32-bit floating point data is transferred into discrete 8-bit or 16-bit integer output format for display or export. It can also be used for creative posterization effects.&#xA;Although not an inherent problem in any of darktable&amp;rsquo;s modules, some operations may provoke banding if they produce a lightness gradient in the image. To mitigate possible artifacts you should consider activating dithering when using the vignetting or graduated density modules.</description>

      <description>Automatically reduce the effect of dust and haze in the atmosphere. This module may also be employed more generally to give pictures a color boost specifically in low-contrast regions of the image.&#xA;Haze absorbs light from objects in the scene but it is also a source of diffuse background light. The haze removal module first estimates, for each image region, the amount of haze in the scene. It then removes the diffuse background light according to its local strength and recovers the original object light.</description>

      <description>Define how darktable will interpret the colors of the image.&#xA;This module takes the color space used by the image source (e.g. camera, scanner) and converts the pixel encodings to a standardized working color space. This means that subsequent modules in the pipeline don&amp;rsquo;t need to be concerned with the specifics of the input device, and can work with and convert to/from a common working color space.&#xA;Where an image has been captured in a raw file, the input color profile module will normally apply either a standard or enhanced color matrix specific for that camera model, which will be used to map the colors into the working profile color space.</description>

      <description>Create a two color linear toning effect where the shadows and highlights are represented by two different colors.&#xA;The split-toning module does not convert images to black and white and has limited benefits on color images. In order to perform traditional split-toning, the input to this module should therefore be monochrome.&#xA;🔗module controls shadows and highlights color Set the desired hue and saturation for both shadows and highlights. Clicking on the colored squares will open a color selector dialog which offers you a choice of commonly used colors, or allows you to define a color in RGB color space.</description>

      <description>Smooth image surfaces while preserving sharp edges using a bilateral filter.&#xA;This module can be used to denoise images, however you should be aware that bilateral filters are susceptible to overshoots and darktable offers much better alternatives. For example, the astrophoto denoise module uses a non-local means denoising algorithm, and the denoise (profiled) module provides a choice between non-local means and wavelet denoising algorithms.&#xA;The surface blur module blurs noise within the surfaces of an image by averaging pixels with their neighbors, taking into account not only their geometric distance but also their distance on the range scale (i.</description>

      <description>Add a correction curve to image data. This is required if you have selected certain input profiles in the input color profile module.&#xA;If you decide to use an ICC profile from the camera manufacturer in the input color profile module, a correction curve frequently needs to be pre-applied to image data to prevent the final output from looking too dark. This extra processing is not required if you use darktable&amp;rsquo;s standard or enhanced color matrices.</description>
