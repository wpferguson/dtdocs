      <description>Remove image noise while preserving structure.&#xA;This is accomplished by averaging each pixel with some surrounding pixels in the image. The weight of such a pixel in the averaging process depends on the similarity of its neighborhood with the neighborhood of the pixel being denoised. A patch with a defined size is used to measure that similarity.&#xA;As denoising is a resource-intensive process, it slows down pixelpipe processing significantly. Consider activating this module late in your workflow.</description>

      <description>Simulate the in-camera JPEG by applying a characteristic base curve to the image.&#xA;darktable comes with a number of base curve presets that attempt to mimic the curves of various camera manufacturers. These presets are automatically applied according to the manufacturer ID found in the image&amp;rsquo;s Exif data. Camera-specific base curve presets are also available for some camera models.&#xA;This module will be enabled by default if preferences &amp;gt; processing &amp;gt; auto-apply pixel workflow defaults is set to &amp;ldquo;display-referred&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>A versatile tool for adjusting the image&amp;rsquo;s color balance.&#xA;This module can be used to revert parasitic color casts or to enhance the visual atmosphere of an image using color grading, a popular technique in the cinema industry. For scene-referred workflow, you should consider using the improved color balance rgb module instead.&#xA;🔗overview The color balance module allows you to shift colors selectively by luminance range (shadows, mid-tones, and highlights). It can do this using two different methods:</description>

      <description>Selectively adjust the hue, saturation, and/or brightness of pixels based on their current hue.&#xA;This module is an attempt to recreate some of the functionality of the color zones module in the scene-referred part of the pipeline whilst overcoming some of that module&amp;rsquo;s limitations. Specifically, the color zones module is prone to increase chroma/luma noise, and introduce artefacts or harsh transitions. These are somewhat mitigated within color equalizer with the following additions:</description>

      <description>Recover color information in blown-out highlights.&#xA;Due to the nature of digital sensors, overexposed highlights lack valid color information. Most frequently they appear neutral white or exhibit some color cast, depending on what other image processing steps are involved. This module can be used to “heal” overexposed highlights by replacing their colors with better fitting ones. The module acts on pixels whose luminance exceeds a user-defined threshold. Replacement colors are taken from neighboring pixels.</description>

      <description>Control how raw files are demosaiced.&#xA;🔗bayer filters The sensor cells of a digital camera are not color-sensitive &amp;ndash; they are only able to record different levels of lightness. In order to obtain a color image, each cell is covered by a color filter (red, green or blue) that primarily passes light of that color. This means that each pixel of the raw image only contains information about a single color channel.</description>

      <description>An easy to use and highly efficient denoise module, adapted to the individual noise profiles of a wide range of camera sensors.&#xA;One issue with a lot of denoising algorithms is that they assume that the variance of the noise is independent of the luminosity of the signal. By profiling the noise characteristics of a camera&amp;rsquo;s sensor at different ISO settings, the variance at different luminosities can be assessed, and the denoising algorithm can be adjusted to more evenly smooth out the noise.</description>

      <description>Photography has a long history of producing monochrome images, and many still enjoy this aspect of photography. While there are some specialized/modified cameras with a truly monochrome sensor, most still use a regular camera to capture a color image and transform it into a monochrome image during post-processing.&#xA;There are two main approaches to this conversion:&#xA;A physical approach, where we attempt to simulate how a silver-based photographic film emulsion would react to the light captured at the scene.</description>

      <description>Diffusion is a family of physical processes by which particles move and spread gradually with time, from a source that generates them. In image processing, diffusion mostly occurs in two places:&#xA;diffusion of photons through lens glass (blur) or humid air (hazing), diffusion of pigments in wet inks or watercolors. In both cases, diffusion makes the image less sharp by &amp;ldquo;leaking&amp;rdquo; particles and smoothing local variations.&#xA;The diffuse or sharpen module uses a generalized physical model to describe several kinds of diffusion, and can be used by image makers to either simulate or revert diffusion processes.</description>

      <guid>https://darktable-org.github.io/dtdocs/en/module-reference/processing-modules/dither-or-posterize/</guid>
      <description>This module eliminates some of the banding artifacts that can result when darktable&amp;rsquo;s internal 32-bit floating point data is transferred into discrete 8-bit or 16-bit integer output format for display or export. It can also be used for creative posterization effects.&#xA;Although not an inherent problem in any of darktable&amp;rsquo;s modules, some operations may provoke banding if they produce a lightness gradient in the image. To mitigate possible artifacts you should consider activating dithering when using the vignetting or graduated density modules.</description>

      <description>Simulate human lowlight vision. This module can also be used to perform a day-to-night conversion.&#xA;The idea is to calculate a scotopic vision image, which is perceived by the rods rather than the cones in the eyes under low light. Scotopic lightness is then mixed with photopic value (regular color image pixel) using some blending function. This module can also simulate the Purkinje effect by adding some blueness to the dark parts of the image.</description>

      <description>darktable employs a fully color managed workflow:&#xA;Input color specifications are taken from embedded or user-supplied ICC profiles or (in the case of raw files) from a library of camera-specific color matrices.&#xA;darktable automatically reads the display profile of your monitor (if properly configured) for accurate on-screen color rendition. Multiple-screen setups are fully supported as long as a system service like colord is in place and properly configured to inform darktable of the correct monitor profile.</description>

      <description>darktable-chart is a tool for extracting luminance and color values from images of color reference cards such as IT8.7/1 charts. Its main purpose is to compare a source image (typically a largely unprocessed raw image) to a target image (typically a JPEG image created in-camera) and produce a darktable style that is able to use the luminance and color values of the source image to produce the target image. This style employs the tone curve module, the input color profile module, and the color look up table module for that purpose.</description>

      <description>Automatically correct for converging lines, a form of perspective distortion. The underlying mechanism is inspired by Markus Hebel&amp;rsquo;s ShiftN program. This module also allows for the rotation of the image to be adjusted.&#xA;Perspective distortions are a natural effect when projecting a three dimensional scene onto a two dimensional plane and cause objects close to the viewer to appear larger than objects further away. Converging lines are a special case of perspective distortions frequently seen in architectural photographs &amp;ndash; parallel lines, when photographed at an angle, are transformed into converging lines that meet at some vantage point within or outside of the image frame.</description>

      <description>darktable is a non-destructive image editor and opens all images in read-only mode. Any data created within darktable (metadata, tags, and image processing steps) is stored in separate .XMP sidecar files. These files are stored alongside the original Raw files and allow darktable to store information about the images as well as the full editing history without touching the original raw files. When you import an image into darktable for the first time, an XMP file is automatically generated.</description>

      <description>The basic element of image processing in darktable is the processing module. In order to process a raw image a number of such modules act on the input image in sequence, each performing a different operation on the image data. For those familiar with Adobe Photoshop, the concept of a processing module in darktable is analogous to that of an adjustment layer in that both make an incremental adjustment to the image, building on top of the adjustments that came before.</description>

      <description>Processing high resolution images is a demanding task requiring a modern computer. In terms of both memory and CPU power, getting the best out of a typical 15, 20 or 25 megapixel image can quickly take your computer to its limits.&#xA;darktable&amp;rsquo;s requirements are no exception. All calculations are performed on 4 x 32bit floating point numbers. This is slower than “ordinary” 8 or 16 bit integer algebra, but eliminates all problems of tonal breaks or loss of information.</description>

Many of the parameters listed below can also be modified with a graphical control that overlays the image when the module has focus, showing the shape and extent of the effect.&#xA;Note: This module is known to provoke banding artifacts under certain conditions. You should consider activating the dither or posterize module to alleviate this.</description>

      <description>Blend modes define how the input and output of a module are combined (blended) together before the module&amp;rsquo;s final output is passed to the next module in the pixelpipe.&#xA;Classic blending modes, designed for display-referred RGB (constrained to 0-100%), implicitly define a fulcrum at 50% (gray) or 100% (white) in their algorithms, depending on the blend mode. Because scene-referred is not subject to these restrictions, this fulcrum needs to be explicitly defined by the user when performing blending operations in the &amp;ldquo;RGB (scene)&amp;rdquo; color space.</description>

Once a shape has been drawn on an image it can be adjusted, removed, or reused in other modules.&#xA;Shapes are stored internally as vectors and are rendered with the required resolution during pixelpipe processing. Shapes are expressed in the coordinate system of the original image and are transformed along with the rest of the image by any active distorting modules in the pipe (lens correction, rotate and perspective for example).</description>

      <description>As you can imagine, the hardware architecture of GPUs can vary significantly. There are different manufacturers, and even different generations of GPUs from the same manufacturer may not be comparable. At the same time GPU manufacturers don&amp;rsquo;t normally disclose all the hardware details of their products to the public. One of the consequences of this is the need to use proprietary drivers under Linux, if you want to take full advantage of your graphics card.</description>

      <description>When importing an image, darktable automatically checks if it is accompanied by a sidecar file. As well as looking for files named &amp;lt;basename&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;extension&amp;gt;.xmp and &amp;lt;basename&amp;gt;_&amp;lt;number&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;extension&amp;gt;.xmp (darktable&amp;rsquo;s XMP file naming formats) darktable also checks for the presence of a file in the form &amp;lt;basename&amp;gt;.xmp (the naming format for Lightroom&amp;rsquo;s XMP sidecar files). Files with the latter naming format will be read by darktable but will not be written to. Once the image has been imported, darktable will generate an additional XMP file using its own naming convention.</description>

      <description>A number of pre-defined module groups are shipped with darktable and are selectable as presets. These are summarized below.&#xA;All of these presets (with the exception of modules: deprecated and search only) also include the quick access panel. All except the modules: deprecated group include the search bar.&#xA;🔗modules: all This preset contains all modules, sorted according to the traditional module groupings used prior to darktable 3.4, as follows:&#xA;base modules The minimal set of modules normally required to render a presentable image.</description>

      <description>Many of darktable&amp;rsquo;s modules can be applied more than once in the pixelpipe. Each instance of a module behaves independently, taking its input from the module below it in the pixelpipe and delivering its output to the next module.&#xA;As with the base instance of a module, all instances can be moved independently within the pixelpipe either by holding Ctrl+Shift while dragging &amp;amp; dropping or by choosing &amp;ldquo;move up&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;move down&amp;rdquo; in the multiple instances drop-down menu.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a simple example that will print some code on the console. Create a file called luarc in darktable&amp;rsquo;s configuration directory (usually $HOME/.config/darktable/) and add the following line to it:&#xA;print(&amp;#34;Hello World !&amp;#34;) Start darktable and you will see the sentence &amp;ldquo;Hello World !&amp;rdquo; printed on the console. Nothing fancy but it&amp;rsquo;s a start.&#xA;At this point, there is nothing darktable-specific in the script. We simply use Lua&amp;rsquo;s standard print function to print a string.</description>

      <description>Using OpenCL in darktable requires that your PC is equipped with a suitable graphics card and that it has the required libraries in place. Most modern graphics cards from NVIDIA, Intel or AMD come with full OpenCL support. The OpenCL compiler is normally shipped as part of the proprietary graphics driver and is used as a dynamic library called libOpenCL.so. This library must be in a folder where it can be found by your system&amp;rsquo;s dynamic linker.</description>

      <description>The parametric mask feature offers fine-grained selective control over how individual pixels are masked. It does this by automatically generating an intermediate blend mask from user-defined parameters. These parameters are color coordinates rather than the geometrical coordinates used in drawn masks.&#xA;For each data channel of a module (e.g. Lab, RGB) and several virtual data channels (e.g. hue, saturation) you can construct a per-channel opacity function. Depending on each pixel&amp;rsquo;s value for a given data channel this function calculates a blending factor between 0 and 1 (100%) for that pixel.</description>

      <description>Presets allow you to store commonly-used module settings for future use. Some modules already come with pre-defined (internal) presets and you may also define your own (user-defined). Both internal and user-defined presets can be shown by clicking the presets menu in the module header.&#xA;Most of the functionality described here applies to processing modules only. However, presets can also be used with some utility modules. When used with utility modules, the functionality to auto-apply or auto-show presets based on image Exif data is not available.</description>

      <description>🔗memory requirements Processing a Raw image in darktable requires a great deal of system memory. A simple calculation makes this clear: For a 20 megapixel image, darktable requires a 4x32-bit floating point cell to store each pixel, meaning that each full image of this size will require approximately 300MB of memory just to store the image data. In order to actually process this image through a given module, darktable needs at least two buffers (input and output) of this size, with more complex modules potentially requiring several additional buffers for intermediate data.</description>

      <description>The darktable-chart binary is a dedicated utility to create styles out of pairs of images such as RAW+JPEG with in-camera processing. Details about its usage can be found in the using darktable-chart section.&#xA;darktable-chart can either start a GUI or be used as a command-line program.&#xA;darktable-chart [--help] [&amp;lt;input Lab pfm file&amp;gt;] [&amp;lt;cht file&amp;gt;] [&amp;lt;reference cgats/it8 or Lab pfm file&amp;gt;] All parameters are optional, however, if you want to supply the second file name you also need to supply the first one.</description>

      <description>darktable is a non-destructive editor, which means that all changes are recorded in the library database (with a backup stored in an XMP sidecar file), and the original Raw file is left untouched. You therefore need to export images in order to bake your edits into an output file that can be distributed outside of darktable.&#xA;Choose an export scenario.&#xA;The export module offers many options, but by far the most common use is to “save a developed raw image as a JPEG”.</description>

      <description>From any of the lighttable modes, you can display a fully-zoomed preview of the image that is currently under the mouse pointer by pressing and holding down W. This is useful to more closely inspect an image while rating and selecting images.&#xA;Pressing and holding Ctrl+W fully zooms into the image and also identifies any regions of sharpness in the image that may indicate image focus. For this tool to work the input image needs to hold an embedded JPEG thumbnail, which is the case for most raw files.</description>

      <description>darktable will detect OpenCL run-time errors automatically. On detecting an error, it will then reprocess everything on the CPU. While this will slow down processing it should not affect the end result.&#xA;There can be various reasons why OpenCL might fail during the initialization phase. OpenCL depends on hardware requirements and on the presence of certain drivers and libraries. In addition all these have to fit in terms of maker, model and revision number.</description>

      <description>Wavelets are used to separate (or decompose) an image into a number of distinct layers, each containing a different level of detail. After decomposing an image in this way, a module can limit its processing to one or more of these detail layers, and then piece the layers back together again at the end to form its output. This allows us to be surgical about which features in the image we wish to impact when working with a module.</description>

      <description>As described in the previous sections, the final output of a module&amp;rsquo;s mask (the combined effect of any drawn and parametric masks) is a grayscale raster image representing the extent to which the module&amp;rsquo;s effect should be applied to each pixel. This raster image is stored internally for active modules and can be subsequently reused by other modules in the pixelpipe.&#xA;As with any mask, if the opacity value for a pixel in a raster mask is zero the module&amp;rsquo;s input passed through the module unchanged.</description>

      <description>Screens and most image file formats can only encode RGB intensities confined within a certain range. For example, images encoded on 8 bits can only contain values from 0 to 255, images on 10 bits from 0 to 1023, and so on… Graphic standards postulate that the maximum of that range, no matter its actual value, will always represent the maximum brightness that the display medium is able to render, usually between 100 and 160 Cd/m² (or nits) depending on the actual standard.</description>

      <description>Our previous example was a bit limited. In particular the use of a preference for the export path wasn&amp;rsquo;t very nice. We can do better than that by adding elements to the user interface in the export dialog.&#xA;UI elements are created via the darktable.new_widget function. This function takes a type of widget as a parameter and returns a new object corresponding to that widget. You can then set various fields in that widget to set its parameters.</description>

      <description>There are some infrequent situations that still can lead to problematic results unless the user takes some action. Some modules in Lab color space, like levels and monochrome, rely on the fact that the L channels carries all lightness information, with the a and b channels purely representing chroma and hue. Unbounded colors with negative L values are especially problematic to these modules and can lead to black pixel artifacts.</description>

      <description>Control how images are processed.&#xA;🔗image processing always use LittleCMS 2 to apply output color profile If this option is activated, darktable will use the LittleCMS 2 system library to apply the output color profile instead of its own internal routines. This is significantly slower than the default but might give more accurate results in some cases. If the given ICC is LUT-based or contains both a LUT and a matrix, darktable will use LittleCMS 2 to render the colors regardless of this parameter&amp;rsquo;s value (default off).</description>

      <description>Most image processing applications come from the 1990s and/or inherit a 1990s workflow. These applications processed images encoded with 8 bit unsigned integers because it was more memory- and computationally-efficient. However, due to the use of an integer format (which implies rounding errors) they had to apply a &amp;ldquo;gamma&amp;rdquo; (essentially a transfer function applying a power 1/2.2 or 1/2.4 to encode the RGB values) and increase the bit-depth in the low-lights in order to reduce rounding errors there (humans are very sensitive to low-light details).</description>

      <description>🔗introduction MIDI is a communication protocol used by many electronic musical instruments (&amp;ldquo;pianos&amp;rdquo;), digital audio studio equipment (&amp;ldquo;control surfaces&amp;rdquo;) and even dedicated &amp;ldquo;photo editing keyboards&amp;rdquo; like the Loupedeck/Loupedeck+ (but not their later products). Such devices commonly feature sets of keys/buttons and sometimes encoders (knobs/rotors) and faders (sliders). Buttons sometimes feature lights, which makes them ideal for toggling features in darktable, because the lights can reflect the current (on/off) status. Encoders and faders are ideal for use with on-screen sliders in processing modules.</description>

      <description>The scheduling of OpenCL devices can be optimized on most systems using the “OpenCL scheduling profile” settings. However, if your system is equipped with more than one GPU, you might want to set the relative device priority manually. To do this you need to select the “default” scheduling profile and change the settings in the “opencl_device_priority” configuration parameter.&#xA;It is important to understand how darktable uses OpenCL devices. Each processing sequence of an image &amp;ndash; to convert an input to the final output using a history stack &amp;ndash; is run in a pixelpipe.</description>

      <description>Highlight areas of the image that may exhibit luminance or gamut clipping.&#xA;When an image is sent to a display device, each pixel is normally represented as a set of 3 numbers, representing the intensity of the red, green and blue primary colors in the output color space. Because the output color space is usually closely related to hardware with physical limitations, there is a maximum permitted value for the [R,G,B] channels, representing the maximum available intensity for that color space.</description>

      <description>Filter the collection of images displayed in the lighttable view and filmstrip panel using image attributes, optionally pinning filters to the top panel for quick access.&#xA;Once you have defined a collection of images with the collections module, the collection filters module allows you to define additional filters and sort criteria. For example, you might wish to show all images in a given folder using the collections module and then define additional quick filters to narrow-down by star rating and/or color label.</description>

      <description>Filter the images shown in the lighttable view and filmstrip panel using image attributes. This set of filtered images is known as a collection.&#xA;Importing images into darktable stores information about them (filename, path, Exif data, data from XMP sidecar files etc.) in darktable&amp;rsquo;s library database. A collection may be defined by applying filtering rules to these attributes, thus creating a subset of images to display in the lighttable view and the filmstrip module.</description>

      <description>Assess colors and brightness in your image using ISO 12646:2008 recommended viewing conditions.&#xA;When developing an image, the way we perceive brightness, contrast and saturation is influenced by the surrounding ambient conditions. If an image is displayed against a dark background, this can have a number of adverse effects on our perception of that image:&#xA;Exaggeration of the perceived exposure makes the image seems brighter than it really is. This is nicely illustrated by the Adelson checkerboard shadow effect.</description>
