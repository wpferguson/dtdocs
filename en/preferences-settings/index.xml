      <description>darktable comes with a number of user-configurable preferences. These can be adjusted in the preferences dialog, which can be reached by clicking the gear icon on the right of the top panel. Preferences are separated into tabs, each of which is described in more detail in the following sections.&#xA;When opened from within the lighttable or darkroom views, the appropriate tab will be loaded by default to allow you to modify that view&amp;rsquo;s settings.</description>

      <description>Control the overall look and feel of darktable.&#xA;interface language Set the language of the user interface. This includes the option to enable sentence case (en@truecase) for English. The system default is marked with an * (needs a restart) theme Set the theme for the user interface.

      <description>Control how images are processed.&#xA;ðŸ”—image processing always use LittleCMS 2 to apply output color profile If this option is activated, darktable will use the LittleCMS 2 system library to apply the output color profile instead of its own internal routines. This is significantly slower than the default but might give more accurate results in some cases. If the given ICC is LUT-based or contains both a LUT and a matrix, darktable will use LittleCMS 2 to render the colors regardless of this parameter&amp;rsquo;s value (default off).</description>

      <description>ðŸ”—interface load default shortcuts at startup When launching the application, darktable loads default shortcuts first, and then loads user-defined shortcuts on top. This allows default shortcuts to be overridden with a new action but prevents them from being deleted (since the deleted shortcut will be automatically reloaded on the next restart). Deactivate this preference to stop loading default shortcuts on startup &amp;ndash; only load the user-defined ones (including any defaults that you have not subsequently deleted or overridden).</description>
